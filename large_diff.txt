Given that $AD = 48\\sqrt{2}$ and $AE = 52\\sqrt{2}$, compute $XY$.\n\nRemember to put your answer on its own line after "Answer:".<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I need to solve this geometry problem. Let me try to visualize it first. There\'s an isosceles triangle ABC with a right angle at A. So, angle A is 90 degrees, and since it\'s isosceles, sides AB and AC must be equal. Wait, in an isosceles right triangle, the legs are equal, and the hypotenuse is leg * sqrt(2). But the problem says ABC is isosceles with angle A = 90°, so yes, AB = AC. \n\nNow, points D and E are on AB and AC respectively. Then, X and Y are the feet of the altitudes from D and E to BC. Given AD = 48√2 and AE = 52√2, need to find XY.\n\nFirst, maybe I should assign coordinates to the triangle to make it easier. Let me place point A at the origin (0,0). Since it\'s a right triangle with legs AB and AC, let me assume AB is along the x-axis and AC along the y-axis. Since AB = AC, let me denote AB = AC = s. Then coordinates would be:\n\nA: (0, 0)\nB: (s, 0)\nC: (0, s)\nThen BC is the hypotenuse from (s, 0) to (0, s). The equation of BC can be found. The slope of BC is (s - 0)/(0 - s) = -1, so equation is y = -x + s.\n\nNow, points D and E are on AB and AC. Let me parameterize their positions. Since AD = 48√2 and AE = 52√2, but AB and AC are of length s. Wait, but AB and AC are legs of the triangle. However, AD is a segment on AB. So AD is part of AB. So if AB has length s, then AD = 48√2 implies that D is located at (AD, 0) = (48√2, 0). Similarly, AE = 52√2, so E is located at (0, 52√2). Wait, but hold on. If AB and AC are of length s, then AD must be less than or equal to s, and AE as well. But the problem doesn\'t specify the length of AB or AC. Wait, but maybe we need to find s?\n\nWait, but maybe not. Wait, perhaps AB and AC are longer than AD and AE? Wait, the problem doesn\'t state that D and E are between A and B, A and C. Wait, but the problem says "points D and E are selected on sides AB and AC", so they must lie between A and B, A and C. Therefore, AD is a part of AB, so AB must be longer than AD. Similarly, AE is part of AC, so AC must be longer than AE. However, since AB = AC, they must both be longer than AD and AE. But given that AD = 48√2 and AE = 52√2, so AB and AC must be longer than 52√2. But the problem doesn\'t give AB or AC. So maybe we need to find AB and AC?\n\nWait, but perhaps we can find AB and AC from the given information? Wait, no, because AD and AE are given, but unless there\'s more information. Wait, but perhaps there\'s something else. Wait, maybe the triangle ABC is not only isosceles right-angled but we can find its sides?\n\nWait, but the problem doesn\'t give any other lengths. Wait, but maybe the coordinates can be set such that AB and AC are of some length, and then using coordinates, we can find XY?\n\nAlternatively, maybe we can find AB in terms of AD and AE?\n\nWait, no. Wait, maybe I need to think differently. Let me think again.\n\nSince ABC is an isosceles right triangle with right angle at A, then AB = AC, let\'s denote AB = AC = a. Then BC = a√2. Now, points D on AB and E on AC. AD = 48√2, so since AB = a, then BD = AB - AD = a - 48√2. Similarly, AE = 52√2, so EC = AC - AE = a - 52√2.\n\nBut how does this help? Well, we need to find the feet of the altitudes from D and E to BC. So X is the foot from D to BC, and Y is the foot from E to BC. Then need to find XY.\n\nSo maybe I can parametrize coordinates again. Let me proceed with coordinates.\n\nLet me set coordinates as before:\n\nA(0,0), B(a, 0), C(0, a), BC is from (a, 0) to (0, a), equation y = -x + a.\n\nPoint D is on AB. Since AD = 48√2, and AB is along x-axis from (0,0) to (a, 0). Therefore, coordinates of D are (AD, 0) = (48√2, 0).\n\nSimilarly, E is on AC with AE = 52√2, so coordinates of E are (0, 52√2).\n\nNow, need to find the feet of the perpendiculars from D and E to BC. Let me recall that the foot of a perpendicular from a point to a line can be calculated using formulas.\n\nFirst, let me find coordinates of X, foot from D(48√2, 0) to BC: line BC is y = -x + a.\n\nThe formula for foot of perpendicular from point (x0, y0) to line Ax + By + C = 0 is:\n\nX = (B(Bx0 - Ay0) - AC) / (A² + B²)\n\nWait, maybe better to recall the formula. Alternatively, since the line BC has equation x + y = a. So in standard form, x + y - a = 0. Therefore, A = 1, B = 1, C = -a.\n\nThe formula for foot of perpendicular from (x0, y0) is:\n\nx = x0 - A*(Ax0 + By0 + C)/(A² + B²)\n\nSimilarly for y. Wait, no, the formula is:\n\nThe coordinates of the foot can be calculated by projecting the point onto the line.\n\nAlternatively, parametric equations.\n\nAlternatively, since we know the line BC: y = -x + a. The slope of BC is -1, so the slope of the perpendicular is 1.\n\nSo, for point D(48√2, 0), the foot X lies on BC and the line DX is perpendicular to BC. Therefore, the line DX has slope 1. So equation of DX is y - 0 = 1*(x - 48√2), so y = x - 48√2.\n\nIntersection of this line with BC: y = -x + a and y = x - 48√2. Setting equal:\n\nx - 48√2 = -x + a => 2x = a + 48√2 => x = (a + 48√2)/2\n\nThen y = x - 48√2 = (a + 48√2)/2 - 48√2 = (a + 48√2 - 96√2)/2 = (a - 48√2)/2.\n\nTherefore, coordinates of X are ((a + 48√2)/2, (a - 48√2)/2)\n\nSimilarly, for point E(0, 52√2), the foot Y on BC. The line perpendicular to BC from E has slope 1 (since BC slope is -1). Therefore, equation of line EY is y - 52√2 = 1*(x - 0), so y = x + 52√2.\n\nIntersecting with BC: y = -x + a and y = x + 52√2.\n\nSet equal: x + 52√2 = -x + a => 2x = a - 52√2 => x = (a - 52√2)/2\n\nThen y = x + 52√2 = (a - 52√2)/2 + 52√2 = (a - 52√2 + 104√2)/2 = (a + 52√2)/2\n\nTherefore, coordinates of Y are ((a - 52√2)/2, (a + 52√2)/2)\n\nNow, need to compute distance between X and Y.\n\nCoordinates of X: ((a + 48√2)/2, (a - 48√2)/2)\n\nCoordinates of Y: ((a - 52√2)/2, (a + 52√2)/2)\n\nSo the difference in x-coordinates: [(a - 52√2)/2 - (a + 48√2)/2] = [ -52√2 - 48√2 ] / 2 = (-100√2)/2 = -50√2\n\nDifference in y-coordinates: [(a + 52√2)/2 - (a - 48√2)/2] = [52√2 + 48√2]/2 = 100√2 / 2 = 50√2\n\nTherefore, the distance XY is sqrt[ (-50√2)^2 + (50√2)^2 ] = sqrt[ (2500*2) + (2500*2) ] = sqrt[ 5000 + 5000 ] = sqrt[10000] = 100.\n\nWait, that\'s interesting! The distance XY is 100, regardless of the value of a? But how?\n\nWait, but this seems strange. Because in the coordinates, the difference in x was -50√2 and difference in y was +50√2, so the distance is sqrt( ( -50√2 )² + (50√2 )² ) = sqrt( 50² * 2 + 50² * 2 ) = sqrt( 2*50²*2 ) = sqrt( 200*25 )? Wait, wait:\n\nWait, (50√2)^2 is 2500 * 2 = 5000. So adding two of those: 5000 + 5000 = 10000. sqrt(10000) = 100. So yes, 100. So regardless of a? That seems surprising. But how?\n\nBut that would mean that XY is 100 regardless of the length of AB and AC? But that seems counterintuitive. How can the distance between the feet of the perpendiculars from D and E be fixed even if the triangle is scaled?\n\nBut maybe that\'s the case here. Wait, but in this problem, AD and AE are given as specific values. However, in our calculation, the value of a canceled out. So maybe the answer is 100?\n\nBut wait, but in the problem, ABC is an isosceles right triangle, but we haven\'t used the fact that AB = AC. Wait, but in our coordinate system, we set AB = AC = a. However, in our calculation, the coordinates of X and Y didn\'t depend on a? Wait, but how?\n\nWait, let me check the coordinates again.\n\nFor X: ((a + 48√2)/2, (a - 48√2)/2)\n\nFor Y: ((a - 52√2)/2, (a + 52√2)/2)\n\nSo when we compute the difference, the a terms cancel out. For example, in the x-coordinate difference:\n\n[(a - 52√2)/2 - (a + 48√2)/2] = [a - 52√2 - a - 48√2]/2 = (-100√2)/2 = -50√2. Similarly for y-coordinate difference, [ (a + 52√2)/2 - (a - 48√2)/2 ] = [a + 52√2 - a + 48√2]/2 = (100√2)/2 = 50√2. Therefore, the difference is indeed independent of a. Therefore, XY is sqrt( (-50√2)^2 + (50√2)^2 ) = sqrt( 5000 + 5000 ) = sqrt(10000) = 100. So the answer is 100. \n\nBut wait, that seems too straightforward. Is there a mistake here?\n\nWait, but let me think again. Suppose we take specific values for a. Let\'s say, for example, take a very large a, so that points D and E are far from B and C. Then, the feet of the perpendiculars would be somewhere on BC. But according to this, XY is always 100 regardless of a. But that seems counterintuitive. However, mathematically, the calculation seems to show that. \n\nAlternatively, maybe there is a mistake in the coordinates? Let me check the coordinates of X and Y again.\n\nFor X, foot from D(48√2, 0) to BC. The line BC is y = -x + a. So the foot X is found by solving the two equations: y = -x + a and y = x - 48√2. Solving gives x = (a + 48√2)/2, y = (a - 48√2)/2. Correct.\n\nSimilarly for Y, foot from E(0, 52√2) to BC: line y = x + 52√2. Solving with y = -x + a gives x = (a - 52√2)/2, y = (a + 52√2)/2. Correct.\n\nThen, coordinates of X and Y. Then, the differences in coordinates. So difference in x is [(a - 52√2)/2 - (a + 48√2)/2] = (-100√2)/2 = -50√2, and difference in y is [(a + 52√2)/2 - (a - 48√2)/2] = (100√2)/2 = 50√2. So yes, the differences are fixed. Then, the distance between X and Y is sqrt( ( -50√2 )² + (50√2 )² ) = sqrt( 2*(50√2)^2 ) = sqrt( 2*(2500*2) ) = sqrt(10000) = 100. \n\nTherefore, regardless of the value of a, XY is 100. Therefore, the answer is 100. \n\nBut why is that? Intuitively, if the triangle is larger, but the points D and E are fixed distances from A, then maybe the feet of the perpendiculars move but their distance remains the same? That seems possible, but maybe there\'s a more geometric way to see this. \n\nAlternatively, since BC is fixed in direction, and the feet of the perpendiculars from D and E are related to their coordinates. But in this case, since the coordinates of X and Y are dependent on a, but when you take the difference, a cancels. \n\nAlternatively, maybe we can think in terms of vectors or parametric equations. But the calculation seems consistent.\n\nAlternatively, let me check with specific numbers. Let me choose a value for a such that AD and AE are within AB and AC. For example, let me take a = 100√2. Then AB = AC = 100√2. Then AD = 48√2 is less than AB, and AE = 52√2 is less than AC. So that\'s okay.\n\nThen coordinates of X: ((a + 48√2)/2, (a - 48√2)/2) = ((100√2 + 48√2)/2, (100√2 - 48√2)/2) = (148√2 / 2, 52√2 / 2) = (74√2, 26√2)\n\nCoordinates of Y: ((a - 52√2)/2, (a + 52√2)/2) = ((100√2 - 52√2)/2, (100√2 + 52√2)/2) = (48√2 / 2, 152√2 / 2) = (24√2, 76√2)\n\nNow, compute distance between (74√2, 26√2) and (24√2, 76√2):\n\nDifference in x: 74√2 - 24√2 = 50√2\n\nDifference in y: 26√2 - 76√2 = -50√2\n\nThen distance is sqrt( (50√2)^2 + (-50√2)^2 ) = sqrt( 5000 + 5000 ) = sqrt(10000) = 100. Correct.\n\nSo with a specific value of a, we get XY = 100, which matches the previous result. Therefore, the answer is 100. \n\nBut just to be thorough, let me try another a. Let me take a = 100. Wait, but then AB = 100, so AD = 48√2 ≈ 67.88, which is less than 100, so okay. Similarly AE = 52√2 ≈ 73.5, which is less than 100. So okay.\n\nCoordinates of X: ((100 + 48√2)/2, (100 - 48√2)/2 )\n\nCoordinates of Y: ((100 - 52√2)/2, (100 + 52√2)/2 )\n\nCompute differences:\n\nX_x - Y_x = [ (100 + 48√2)/2 - (100 - 52√2)/2 ] = [ (100 + 48√2 - 100 + 52√2)/2 ] = (100√2)/2 = 50√2\n\nX_y - Y_y = [ (100 - 48√2)/2 - (100 + 52√2)/2 ] = [ (100 - 48√2 - 100 - 52√2)/2 ] = (-100√2)/2 = -50√2\n\nSo distance is sqrt( (50√2)^2 + (-50√2)^2 ) = same as before, 100. Therefore, even with a different a, same result. Therefore, seems that answer is indeed 100.\n\nSo, conclusion: XY = 100. Therefore, answer is \\boxed{100}\n\n**Final Answer**\n\\boxed{100}\n</think>\n\nTo solve the problem, we begin by setting up a coordinate system that reflects the geometric properties of triangle $ ABC $, which is an isosceles right triangle with a right angle at vertex $ A $.\n\n---\n\n### Step 1: Coordinate Setup\n\nLet us place the triangle in the coordinate plane as follows:\n\n- Let point $ A $ be the origin: $ A = (0, 0) $.\n- Since $ \\angle A = 90^\\circ $ and $ \\triangle ABC $ is isosceles, we set:\n  - $ B = (a, 0) $\n  - $ C = (0, a) $\n- Therefore, side $ AB = AC = a $, and the hypotenuse $ BC $ lies along the line $ y = -x + a $.\n\nNow, points $ D $ and $ E $ lie on sides $ AB $ and $ AC $, respectively. Using the given lengths $ AD = 48\\sqrt{2} $ and $ AE = 52\\sqrt{2} $, we find their coordinates:\n\n- Since $ D $ is on $ AB $, and $ AB $ is the x-axis, we place $ D = (48\\sqrt{2}, 0) $\n- Since $ E $ is on $ AC $, and $ AC $ is the y-axis, we place $ E = (0, 52\\sqrt{2}) $\n\n---\n\n### Step 2: Finding the Feet of the Perpendiculars\n\nWe now find the feet of the perpendiculars from points $ D $ and $ E $ to the hypotenuse $ BC $, which lies on the line $ x + y = a $.\n\n#### a) Foot of Perpendicular from $ D = (48\\sqrt{2}, 0) $\n\nThe line $ BC $ is $ x + y = a $, and a line perpendicular to it has slope 1 (since the slope of $ BC $ is -1). So, the perpendicular from $ D $ has equation:\n\n$$\ny = x - 48\\sqrt{2}\n$$\n\nTo find the foot $ X $, solve the system:\n\n$$\n\\begin{cases}\nx + y = a \\\\\ny = x - 48\\sqrt{2}\n\\end{cases}\n$$\n\nSubstitute $ y = x - 48\\sqrt{2} $ into the first equation:\n\n$$\nx + (x - 48\\sqrt{2}) = a \\Rightarrow 2x = a + 48\\sqrt{2} \\Rightarrow x = \\frac{a + 48\\sqrt{2}}{2}\n$$\n\nThen $ y = x - 48\\sqrt{2} = \\frac{a + 48\\sqrt{2}}{2} - 48\\sqrt{2} = \\frac{a - 48\\sqrt{2}}{2} $\n\nSo, $ X = \\left( \\frac{a + 48\\sqrt{2}}{2}, \\frac{a - 48\\sqrt{2}}{2} \\right) $\n\n#### b) Foot of Perpendicular from $ E = (0, 52\\sqrt{2}) $\n\nSimilarly, the perpendicular from $ E $ has slope 1 and passes through $ (0, 52\\sqrt{2}) $, so the line is:\n\n$$\ny = x + 52\\sqrt{2}\n$$\n\nSolving with $ x + y = a $:\n\n$$\nx + (x + 52\\sqrt{2}) = a \\Rightarrow 2x = a - 52\\sqrt{2} \\Rightarrow x = \\frac{a - 52\\sqrt{2}}{2}\n$$\n\nThen $ y = x + 52\\sqrt{2} = \\frac{a - 52\\sqrt{2}}{2} + 52\\sqrt{2} = \\frac{a + 52\\sqrt{2}}{2} $\n\nSo, $ Y = \\left( \\frac{a - 52\\sqrt{2}}{2}, \\frac{a + 52\\sqrt{2}}{2} \\right) $\n\n---\n\n### Step 3: Calculating Distance $ XY $\n\nWe now compute the distance between points $ X $ and $ Y $:\n\nLet:\n\n- $ X = \\left( \\frac{a + 48\\sqrt{2}}{2}, \\frac{a - 48\\sqrt{2}}{2} \\right) $\n- $ Y = \\left( \\frac{a - 52\\sqrt{2}}{2}, \\frac{a + 52\\sqrt{2}}{2} \\right) $\n\nThen, the difference in x-coordinates:\n\n$$\nx_X - x_Y = \\frac{a + 48\\sqrt{2}}{2} - \\frac{a - 52\\sqrt{2}}{2} = \\frac{100\\sqrt{2}}{2} = 50\\sqrt{2}\n$$\n\nThe difference in y-coordinates:\n\n$$\ny_X - y_Y = \\frac{a - 48\\sqrt{2}}{2} - \\frac{a + 52\\sqrt{2}}{2} = \\frac{-100\\sqrt{2}}{2} = -50\\sqrt{2}\n$$\n\nSo the distance $ XY $ is:\n\n$$\nXY = \\sqrt{(50\\sqrt{2})^2 + (-50\\sqrt{2})^2} = \\sqrt{5000 + 5000} = \\sqrt{10000} = 100\n$$\n\n---\n\n### Final Answer\n\n$$\n\\boxed{100}\n$$<|im_end|>'], label: 100, reward: 1
