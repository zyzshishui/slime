**slime** is an LLM post-training framework for RL scaling, providing two core capabilities:

1.  **High-Performance Training**: Supports efficient training in various modes by connecting Megatron with SGLang;
2.  **Flexible Data Generation**: Enables arbitrary training data generation workflows through custom data generation interfaces and server-based engines.

## Architecture Overview

![arch](./imgs/arch.png)

**Module Descriptions**:

  - **training (Megatron)**: Responsible for the main training process, reads data from the Data Buffer, and synchronizes parameters to the rollout module after training.
  - **rollout (SGLang + router)**: Generates new data (including rewards/verifier outputs) and stores it in the Data Buffer.
  - **data buffer**: A bridge module that manages prompt initialization, custom data, and rollout generation methods.

## Quick Start

For a comprehensive quick start guide covering environment setup, data preparation, training startup, and key code analysis, please refer to:
- [Quick Start Guide](./docs/en/get_started/quick_start.md)

We also provide examples for some usecases not covered in the quick start guide, please check [examples](examples/).

## Arguments Walk Through

Arguments in slime are divided into three categories:

1.  **Megatron arguments**: slime reads all arguments set in Megatron via `PYTHONPATH`. You can configure Megatron by passing arguments like `--tensor-model-parallel-size 2`.
2.  **SGLang arguments**: All arguments for the installed SGLang are supported. These arguments must be prefixed with `--sglang-`. For example, `--mem-fraction-static` should be passed as `--sglang-mem-fraction-static`.
3.  **slime-specific arguments**: Please refer to: [slime/utils/arguments.py](slime/utils/arguments.py)

For complete usage instructions, please refer to the [Usage Documentation](docs/en/get_started/usage.md).

## Developer Guide

  - **Contributions are welcome\!** If you have suggestions for new features, performance tuning, or feedback on user experience, feel free to submit an Issue or PR 😊

  - Use [pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com/) to ensure code style consistency for your commits:

    ```bash
    apt install pre-commit -y
    pre-commit install
    ```
