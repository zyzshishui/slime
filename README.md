**slime** is an LLM post-training framework for RL scaling, providing two core capabilities:

1.  **High-Performance Training**: Supports efficient training in various modes by connecting Megatron with SGLang;
2.  **Flexible Data Generation**: Enables arbitrary training data generation workflows through custom data generation interfaces and server-based engines.

slime is the RL-framework behind [GLM-4.5](https://z.ai/blog/glm-4.5) and [GLM-4.6](https://z.ai/blog/glm-4.6) and apart from models from Z.ai, we also supports the following models:
- Qwen3 series (Qwen3Next, Qwen3MoE, Qwen3), Qwen2.5 series;
- DeepSeek V3 series (DeepSeek V3, V3.1, DeepSeek R1);
- Llama 3.

## Architecture Overview

![arch](./imgs/arch.png)

**Module Descriptions**:

  - **training (Megatron)**: Responsible for the main training process, reads data from the Data Buffer, and synchronizes parameters to the rollout module after training.
  - **rollout (SGLang + router)**: Generates new data (including rewards/verifier outputs) and stores it in the Data Buffer.
  - **data buffer**: A bridge module that manages prompt initialization, custom data, and rollout generation methods.

## Quick Start

For a comprehensive quick start guide covering environment setup, data preparation, training startup, and key code analysis, please refer to:
- [Quick Start Guide](./docs/en/get_started/quick_start.md)

We also provide examples for some use cases not covered in the quick start guide; please check [examples](examples/).

## Projects Built upon slime

slime has powered several novel research projects and production systems. Here are some notable examples:

### ⚡ TritonForge: Agentic RL Training Framework for Kernel Generation

[**TritonForge**](https://github.com/RLsys-Foundation/TritonForge) leverages slime's SFT & RL capabilities to train LLMs that automatically generate optimized GPU kernels. By using a two-stage training approach—supervised fine-tuning followed by reinforcement learning with multi-turn compilation feedback—TritonForge achieves remarkable results in converting PyTorch operations into high-performance Triton kernels.

### 🚀 APRIL: Accelerating RL Training with Active Partial Rollouts

[**APRIL**](https://github.com/RLsys-Foundation/APRIL) introduces a system-level optimization that seamlessly integrates with slime to accelerate the rollout generation phase in RL training. By intelligently over-provisioning requests and actively managing partial completions, APRIL addresses the long-tail generation bottleneck that typically consumes over 90% of RL training time.

These projects showcase slime's versatility—from training code-generation models to optimizing RL training systems—making it a powerful foundation for both research and production deployments.

## Arguments Walkthrough

Arguments in slime are divided into three categories:

1.  **Megatron arguments**: slime reads all arguments set in Megatron via `PYTHONPATH`. You can configure Megatron by passing arguments like `--tensor-model-parallel-size 2`.
2.  **SGLang arguments**: All arguments for the installed SGLang are supported. These arguments must be prefixed with `--sglang-`. For example, `--mem-fraction-static` should be passed as `--sglang-mem-fraction-static`.
3.  **slime-specific arguments**: Please refer to: [slime/utils/arguments.py](slime/utils/arguments.py)

For complete usage instructions, please refer to the [Usage Documentation](docs/en/get_started/usage.md).
